# TaylorSeries

This sample Python application calculates the [sine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine) of an angle
defined in [Radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian).
Calculation is performed with [Taylor series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series).
Final result is compared to a [sin](https://docs.python.org/2/library/math.html) method from `math` package
and with the [Stirling's approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximation).
